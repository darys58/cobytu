  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Releway
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
    - family: RobotoCondensed
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoCondensed-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoCondensed-Bold.ttf

        - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoCondensed-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoCondensed-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
